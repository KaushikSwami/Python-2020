# 2) With a given tuple, Write a program to print the first
# half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

# Sample Input : (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 11)
# Expected output : (1,2,3,4,5) (6,7,8,9,10)

value =(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 11)
print(value[:5],value[5:10])

# o/p
# (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
